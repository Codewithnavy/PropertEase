The real estate industry is known for its complexity and lack 
of transparency and has a lot of undiscovered potential.
• Property buyers and sellers often struggle to find accurate and 
up-to-date information about available properties and their 
market value.
• The process of buying or selling a property can be time consuming and daunting, with numerous legal and financial 
hurdles to navigate and users don’t have much options because 
there are 3 to 4 big companies which hold this field completely.
• A term “premium” is kind of unjust as great amount of money is 
needed just to contact the other person and therefore to tackle 
these issues, we create a user-friendly and comprehensive 
property dealing app that streamlines the buying and selling 
process.
• The app should enable users to easily search for properties, view 
property details and prices, connect with buyers and sellers, and 
facilitate secure and efficient transactions.
